something similar applies to dictionaries and sets â€” there's an intermediary step that resolves where's the index

I think the point of today is to siphon off some of the abstractness of programming with Python (or programming in general, more so).
So we're going down a level by mocking out some of the functionality built into Python (i.e., making our own islower() function).

But if we couldn't use ord(), we'd spend the rest of the afternoon building out what ord() does in addition to what islower() does
